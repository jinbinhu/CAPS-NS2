Description:
These are simple implementations of CAPS and CAPS-dark on ns-2.35.

Usage:
1. All the patch files ('CAPS.patch' and 'CAPS-dark.patch') should be on original ns-2.35.
   put the patch file outside 'ns-2.35' folder, but inside 'ns-allinone-2.35' folder. 

2. type  'patch -p6 < caps.patch' for CAPS
	 'patch -p6 < caps-dark.patch' for CAPS-dark

3. the following listed files will be changed successfully if previous operations are done properly.

patching file ns-2.35/classifier/classifier-mpath.cc
patching file ns-2.35/classifier/hjbextra.h
patching file ns-2.35/tcl/lib/ns-default.tcl
patching file ns-2.35/tcp/tcp.h
patching file ns-2.35/tcp/tcp.cc
patching file ns-2.35/tcp/tcp-sink.h
patching file ns-2.35/tcp/tcp-sink.cc
patching file ns-2.35/common/agent.cc
patching file ns-2.35/common/agent.h
patching file ns-2.35/queue/mydrop-tail.h
patching file ns-2.35/queue/mydrop-tail.cc
patching file ns-2.35/Makefile

4. compile the codes
	cd ns-2.35
	make

5. Now you can run the simple testcases in ns-2.35 directory
	./ns many-to-many.tcl
	./ns many-to-one.tcl
